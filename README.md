## Dataset
The Black Friday dataset originally made available by Analytics Vidhya and publicly accessible through Kaggle. The data set contains some variables related to commercial transactions carried out during Black Friday at a given retail store. Each observation relates to a particular item purchased by a user and a user may have purchased more than one item.

## Goal
The main goal of this challenge is to extract some quantitative information that will help us understand the nature of the data available and gain some insights about the dataset.

## Language 
Python

## Libraries
### Pandas
It is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It is free software released under the three-clause BSD license. The name is derived from the term "panel data", an econometrics term for data sets that include observations over multiple time periods for the same individuals.

### Numpy
It is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. The ancestor of NumPy, Numeric, was originally created by Jim Hugunin with contributions from several other developers. In 2005, Travis Oliphant created NumPy by incorporating features of the competing Numarray into Numeric, with extensive modifications. NumPy is open-source software and has many contributors.

### Scipy
It is a free and open-source Python library used for scientific computing and technical computing. SciPy contains modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing, ODE solvers and other tasks common in science and engineering.

### Seaborn
It is a graphic library built on top of Matplotlib. It allows to make your charts prettier, and facilitates some of the common data visualisation needs (like mapping a color to a variable or using faceting).

### Matplotlib
It is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+. There is also a procedural "pylab" interface based on a state machine (like OpenGL), designed to closely resemble that of MATLAB, though its use is discouraged.

### Scikit-learn
It is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.
